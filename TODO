ObexFTP to do list
==================

* transport select patch by Hendrik Sattler

* OBEX-Push-only mode (no UUID) suggested by Antti Hayrynen

* UUID issue (FBS or S45 first?), autodetect phone and re-connect?

* put to specified file (-p file.vcf -f telecom/pb.vcf)

* Discover port and protocol to use (i.e. Bt, IrDA, TTY)


later...

* AT-Kommandos

* "Something went wrong" -- help texts

* Verify unified cable support.

* Tear down BFB connection cleanly - no more cable cycling.

* Document the general vs Siemens specific features

* Path parsing issues (some phones dont know about paths others insist on them)

* Error handling on missing files (either TA or M)

* Use the TAC (Type Approval Code) perhaps. (http://www.nobbi.com/glossar.htm#imei)
